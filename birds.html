                        The grey parrot is a medium-sized, predominantly grey, black-billed parrot.
                          The head and body feathers have slight white edges. 
                          The tail feathers are red. Due to selection by parrot breeders, 
                          some grey parrots are partly or completely red. Both sexes appear similar. 
                          The colouration of juveniles is similar to that of adults, 
                          but typically their eyes are dark grey to black, in comparison to the yellow 
                          irises around dark pupils of the adult birds, and their undertail coverts are tinged with grey.

                        The little budgie bird is one of the most popular pets in the world, ranking just behind dogs and cats,
                         and it's no wonder. This affectionate, cute bird is small and inexpensive, and if trained properly 
                         a budgie can mimic human speech. The origin of its formal name―budgerigar―is a mystery, but by any name,
                        this little bird is a charming companion for most pet owners. 
                        Budgies aren't all fun and games, though, so before you bring one home, make sure you're not in for any surprises.

                        Hummingbirds belong to the avian family Trochilidae, and their closest relatives are the equally fascinating swifts.
                         Hummingbirds are small (weighing 2 to 20 grams), with long, narrow bills and small, saber-like wings.
                        Males (and occasionally females) often have a colorful gorget—small, stiff, highly reflective, colored feathers 
                        on the throat and upper chest. These shiny feathers and others around the head may look sooty black until a hummingbird 
                        turns its head to catch the sun and display the intense, metallic spectral color.
